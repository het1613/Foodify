# Introduction
This is a web app I created which allows users to track their various nutrient intake throughout the day. The user can input the food's name, and the amount of calories, fat, protein and carbs it has. They can then view this item in the "Food Log" which saves the user's items in a database. Additionally, the user has the option to set nutrient intake goals and check how their progress to meeting those goals in the "Summary" section.

# Inspiration
I recently set a goal to eat 3000 calories everyday; however, I had a hard time keeping track of which foods I eat and how much calories I have eats so far. As such, I built a web app that I could use on my computer or phone to track my nutrient intake. It's simple, clean, user-friendly and gets the job done for my needs.

# Technology
This CRUD web app was built using a Flask backend with REST API to manage app routes and process GET/POST requests. I also integrated an SQLAlchemy database to store the user's food items and important values associated with it. Furthermore, I utilized HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a responsive front-end comptaible with desktops, tablets and phones.
